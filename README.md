# VelocidroneWebSocketConsumer
A project to be a proof of concept of things you can do with the velocidrone web socket

# Getting it running
You must turn on websocket communications in your velocidrone settings, also you must be race manager in order to receive websocket data. The websocket currently binds to your local ip and not loopback so ensure you use 192.168.0.2 style ip and not 127.0.0.1
